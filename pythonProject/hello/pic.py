# i am infinite
# hello guys today we are going to program using pickle module
# so let's get into our work
# we need to have a good deal on it
# so let's learn pickle
# import pickle
# dict1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
# file = "xv.pkl"
# p = open(file,"wb")
# pickle.dump(dict1, p)
# p.close()
# c = open("xv.pkl",'rb')
# pickle.load(c)
# print(dict1)
# hello guys we are going to create a program
# what ever is here is a process of pickling
import pickle
# lista = ["water","flush","wisdom"]
# pkl = open("xr.pkl","wb")
# pickle.dump(lista ,pkl)
# pkl.close()
# pr = open("xr.pkl","rb")

# # hello guys today we are going to build a module so let's begin our code
# etc = ["r",1,2,3,4,5]
# pkl = open("rp.pkl","wb")
# pickle.dump(etc,pkl)
# pkl.close()
# pr = open("rp.pkl","rb")
# r = pickle.load(pr)
# print(r)
# finally we are done
# finally we are done with value
etc = ["r",1,2,3,4,5]
print(pickle.dumps(etc))
# now we are clarifies with it
# now let's proceed with the code
import pickle
