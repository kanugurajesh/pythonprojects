# i am infinite
# we are going to use num2words
# python is really a good language to use it is preferred by programmers and many users to execute their wills
# you can also write scripts using python
# import num2words
# from num2words import num2words
# print(num2words(6))
# print(num2words(35))
# print(num2words(66))
# print("you can do many things using this module")
# print(num2words(37,to='ordinal'))
# print(num2words(47,to='ordinal_num'))
# print(num2words(57,to='year'))
# print(num2words(67,to='currency'))
# print(num2words(57,lang='es'))
# # the above one shows language
# # we need to use many things inorder get programming
# from win32com.client import Dispatch
# speaker =Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")
# speaker.speak(num2words(47,to='ordinal_num'))
# # see we are done with the value
# # now we are going to implement many values
# # pillow is also one of the things you can use to open images using python
# from PIL import Image
# import time
# # im = Image.open(r"hello.jpg.jpg")
# # # im.show()
# # print(im.mode)
# # print(im.size)
# # print(im.format)
# # # imga= im.rotate(50)
# # # imga.show()
# # print("hello")
# # # the above code rotates the object
# # # we need to learn about them to create a lot of programs
# # size = (50,50)
# # i = im.resize(size)
# # i.show()
# # use resize only when use because there is a danger of interpolation
# # you doesn't need to know entire code to know programming now let's save a image using python
# # so let's start from beginning of using a code
# impa = Image.open(r"hello.jpg.jpg")
# impa.show()
# time.sleep(5)
# impa.close()
# size = (50,50)
# i = impa.resize(size)
# i.save(r"hello.jpg")
# hello guys we can use split function to do many things
hello = "json is a thing"
xa = hello.split(" ")
print(xa)
# split function generally splits a string into a list we need to have a clear view over it to
