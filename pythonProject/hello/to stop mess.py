# i am infinite
# hello guys today we are going to create a python project so let's use it
from PIL import Image
# impa = Image.open(r"hello.jpg.jpg")
# impa.show()
# import subprocess
# p = subprocess.Popen(r"hello.jpg")
# # raw_input("Give a name for image:")
# p.kill()
inp = input()
# always have a good vision on coding
# if inp==0:
#     impa.close()
#     integer = Image.open(r"just.xp.jpg")
#     integer.show()
# the above code has not worked we need to do new thing in programming
# we cam create new images in python and we can do many things in python
# hello guys we are going to create a new image by cropping it

# size = (50,50 ,100,100)
# # see man writing the variables and initializing them before can do wonders
# instant = Image.open(r"neha.hello.jpg")
# s = instant.crop(size)
# s.show()
# python is used for image processing it is one of the languages we can use to do
import sys
print(sys.argv)
# search for above two lines of code in future
