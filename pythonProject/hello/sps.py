# hello guys we are going to create format thing
# print("hello {}".format(18))
# format has many uses
# str = "hello we are going to create a format program {}"

# see you can use similar things we are
# HELLO GUYS WE ARE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT JSON MODULE IN THIS TUTORIAL IN THIS PROGRAM LET'S BEGIN THE JOURNEY
# json is a built in module
# see we have converted json variable into python dictionary
import json
java  = '{"dhruva":"the immovable","rajesh":"the ruler of the kings","abhiram":"the lord"}'
s = json.loads(java)
print(s['dhruva'])
print(s["dhruva"])
javas = {"dhruva":"the immovable","rajesh":"the ruler of the kings","abhiram":"the lord"}
print(javas["dhruva"])
print(javas['dhruva'])
# see the same has printed in two scenarios
ori = {
    "humanity":"the quality of being a human",
    "hero":"a person who performes heroic deeds",
    "god":"an entity with mercifull heart"
}
sp = json.dumps(ori)
print(sp)
# see we have converted the above code to json file
print(ori['humanity'])
print(ori['hero'])
print("json and dictionary has same type in python but it varies google console")
# hello guys today we are going to create many functions
# finally we are done with loads and dumps
# hello guys we are going to create python program
# finally we have completed our task
