# i am infinite
# hello guys today we are going to learn about some program we will be using
# so let's begin our program
# import sys
# for line in sys.stdin:
#     if 'q'==line.rstrip():
#         break
#     else:
#         print(line)
# print("exit")
# # the above code runs a loop of inputs in the program you need to have a hard grip on the program to learn about them
# # hello guys this is one of the method we can use for taking input from the user using command line utility
# # this is like a loop which is created in the program to create some things in python
# # if you want to learn about something just experiment on it
# import sys
# hello = sys.stdin
# print(hello)
# import sys
# hello = sys.stdin
# if "5"==hello:
#     print(5)
# else:
#     print(hello)
# # i do know the reason why for the above two codes the program is not running at all
# # HELLO GUYS NOW WE ARE GOING TO TAKE INPUT USING FILE INPUT METHOD LET'S START WITH NO DELAY
# # this program gonna be crazy we need to have good command on it
#
# import fileinput
# with fileinput.input(files = ("hellomachine","helloman.txt.txt")) as f:
#     for line in f:
#         print(line)
# # if you guys input extra extension it doesn't provide the written value but provides the object
#
# # you need to print the exact line name because you need to have to mention the file name with no exact extension
# # mistakes are meant for learning not for repeating
# # everything is good if you observe it good have a good deal on everything be anonymous
# # this is one of the methods we can use to read multiple files
# # we can
# import fileinput
# with fileinput.input(files = ('sample.txt', 'no.txt')) as f:
# 	for line in f:
# 		print(line)
#
# import fileinput
# for f in fileinput.input():
#     print(f)
# # in this above program what you input prints the same value
# # this is different from above two program as it takes input from the user of the file and prints the content in it
#
# import fileinput
# for f in fileinput.input(files=input()):
# 	print(f)
# # hello guys this is a program we re
# import fileinput
# for f in fileinput.input(files=input()):
#     print(f)
# # see finally we have completed the program we neeed to have a complete demand on it
# # hello finally we are done with the value
# # PYTHON PROGRAM
# # this gonna be a program we are going to develop we are going to use sys.stdout.write in this program so please tune
# # to go with us
# hello guys now we are going to use stdout module in python we will be having a good deal in it we need to work with it

import sys

sys.stdout.write("hello")
print("json is a module we need to have a good knowledge about it")
# finally we are done with our value
