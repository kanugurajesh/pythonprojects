# i am infinite
# hello guys today we are going to create a program so let's prepare a program to understand our basics in python
# json is a simple module used to communicate so let's use it
# guys in this session we are going to use dump module in python
# see this is one of the files you can use to improve yourself
import json
# so we are going to use some modules in this tutorial
print("hello","bye","man",sep="-")
dictg = {"hello":"just","python":"ai","web development":"framework","creating languages":"making them more effcient"}
sr = open("heaven.txt","w")
# hello guys we are going to create some programs
json.dump(dictg,sr,indent=6)
sr.close()
# to reopen a file after writing you need to take on some steps so let's get into procedural work
f = open("heaven.txt","r")
print(f.read())
f.close()
# finally we have generated the work
# so we are going to use some modules in this tutorial
print("hello","bye","man",sep="-")
dictg = {"hello":"just","python":"ai","web development":"framework","creating languages":"making them more effcient"}
sr = open("heaven.txt","w")
# hello guys we are going to create some programs
json.dump(dictg,sr,indent=6,sort_keys=True)
sr.close()
# to reopen a file after writing you need to take on some steps so let's get into procedural work
f = open("heaven.txt","r")
print(f.read())
sr = open("heaven.txt","w")
# hello guys we are going to create some programs
json.dump(dictg,sr,indent=6,ensure_ascii=True)
sr.close()
# to reopen a file after writing you need to take on some steps so let's get into procedural work
f = open("heaven.txt","r")
print(f.read())
f.close()
# allow_nan helps you to serialize the float values
dict2 = {'x':2,
         'y':float('nan')}
sp = open("man of the man.txt","w")
json.dump(dict2,sp,indent=6,allow_nan=True)
sp.close()
w = open("man of the man.txt","r")
print(w.read())
# sir let's open your problem
f.close()

# so we are going to use some modules in this tutorial
print("hello","bye","man",sep="-")
dictg = {"hello":"just","python":"ai","web development":"framework","creating languages":"making them more efficient"}
# allow nan function as very important role in programming so let's end the programming for today
# hello guys we are going to learn about functions in this tutorial so let's begin our work
# we are going to know about sorted function let's have a quick review on them
# hello guys we are going to create some programs
# we need to create multiple objects
