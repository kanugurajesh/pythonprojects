# i am infinite
# hello guys we are going to create a program let's have a look at it

# business can be prepared using intellect if you own intellect and published then done you have your money and time saved

import sys
import pandas
# hello guys now we are going to build a program which multiplies the values given as input to it as input
# Python program to demonstrate
# age = sys.stdin
# for line in sys.stdin:
#     if line.strip()==17:
#         print("hello guys")
#
#     elif line.strip()>"17":
#         sys.exit("sir age should be above 18 or 18")
#     else:
#         print(age)
# print(sys.path)
# print(sys.modules)
# # sys.modules helps to get the path of the modules that the current shell has imported
# sys.path = []
# # see using this you can truncate the value of sys.path
# print(sys.path)
# finally we have completed the value
# hello guys finally we have printed the value
# and we are going to do it better
# sys module work is to completely deal with the terminal
# we need to have a good command on sys modules to work with terminal
b = 'hello'
print(sys.getrefcount(b))
